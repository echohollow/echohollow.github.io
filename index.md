### 🪪 IdentDaemon — Identity Obfuscation Agent

A lightweight daemon designed to enhance operational privacy by dynamically rotating system identity markers such as MAC address, hostname, DNS server, clock skew, and User-Agent string.

**Potential Use Cases:**
- Support red team operators in bypassing EDRs and anti-bot detection
- Enable pentesters and researchers to conduct resilient assessments without device fingerprinting
- Provide privacy advocates with a stealth tool for digital anonymity

> **Disclaimer:** IdentDaemon will be developed for legitimate research, testing, and privacy enhancement purposes only.
