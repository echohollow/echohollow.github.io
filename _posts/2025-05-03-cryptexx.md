# 🔐 Complete Build — CryptexX

**CryptexX v2.1** is a fully operational, stateless encryption utility engineered for advanced payload protection, covert delivery, and red team pipeline integration.

Designed with **absolute detachment** from host environments, CryptexX delivers **dual-layer encryption (AES-256-CBC + XOR)**, incorporating intelligent padding and compression strategies for reduced signature and maximum entropy.

## 🚀 Official GitHub Release

CryptexX is now available as a **final public build**:

🔗 [CryptexX GitHub Repository](https://github.com/echohollow/CryptexX)

✅ Dual-layer AES-256-CBC and XOR encryption
✅ Stateless operation — no time, hardware, or environment checks
✅ Smart zlib compression and randomized padding
✅ Single `.enc` output file — clean and portable
✅ CLI-native Python3 interface with zero external logging

## ⚙️ Architecture Breakdown

CryptexX operates in three distinct stages:

**1. Input Handling**

* Accepts any binary payload
* Compresses the file using zlib
* Adds randomized padding (no PKCS7 signature patterns)

**2. Encryption Layering**

* Salt + IV are generated per session
* AES key derived via PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 (200,000 rounds)
* Payload encrypted with AES-256-CBC
* Output re-encrypted using a unique XOR mask

**3. Output Compilation**

* Encoded output structure:
  `[Magic Header][Salt][IV][XOR Key][Encrypted Payload]`
* Fully self-contained `.enc` file without execution metadata

## 🔐 Use Cases

CryptexX is ideal for:

* Securing memory-only payloads prior to delivery
* Encrypted storage for red team loaders
* Packing implants for multi-hop deployment
* Use in hybrid C2s, removable media, and covert USB drops

> 🔒 CryptexX makes your payload look like noise — not code.

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

This is not a PoC. **CryptexX is a production-grade encryption layer** engineered for payload survivability across diverse red team infrastructures.
