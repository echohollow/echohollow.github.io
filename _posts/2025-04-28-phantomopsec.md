# 🛰️ Operational Release — PhantomOPSEC v1.0

PhantomOPSEC is a **full-spectrum Windows operational hardening stack**,  
engineered for **adversarial anonymity**, **SOC bypass**, and **forensic survivability**.

It fuses **encrypted traffic shielding**, **hardware identity obfuscation**, **DNS integrity hardening**,  
and **anonymized proxy routing** into a unified, real-time stealth operation chain.

---

## 🚀 Capabilities Breakdown

**Multi-Layer Traffic Anonymization**
- ProtonVPN deployment for baseline encrypted tunneling
- Aggressive country-hopping node selection
- Kill Switch activation to eliminate real IP fallback
- VPN-dedicated DNS resolution enforcement

**Hardware Identity Obfuscation**
- Technitium MAC Address Changer integration
- Dynamic MAC randomization on every network reconnection
- Hardware fingerprint misalignment across network layers

**Encrypted DNS Traffic Control**
- Simple DNSCrypt deployment
- DNS request encryption with Anonymized DNS Relays
- Lockdown of system DNS settings to localhost

**Deep Proxy Anonymity Chain**
- Tor local proxy service (SOCKS5 exposure)
- Socat64 binding for TCP to Tor translation
- Direct tool communication through obfuscated Tor circuits

---

## 🧩 Operational Workflow

1. **Engage ProtonVPN** with Kill Switch and always-on protection activated.
2. **Randomize MAC address** using Technitium before any network communication.
3. **Initialize DNSCrypt** to enforce encrypted, relay-based DNS lookups.
4. **Launch Tor** to establish a local SOCKS5 anonymization endpoint.
5. **Deploy socat64** to reroute selected traffic through the Tor network.
6. **Verify full OPSEC chain integrity** via leak testing and packet capture.

> PhantomOPSEC forges a synthetic identity chain —  
> **a black mirror reflection layered across digital space.**

## 🔥 Real-World Use Cases

- **C2 communications cloaking** for APT red team deployments
- **SOC evasion** during offensive recon or payload staging
- **Forensic artifact suppression** across DNS, MAC, IP, and traffic signatures
- **Deep web infrastructure management** under anonymized identities
- **OPSEC-first payload delivery testing** in hostile network environments

---

## ⚙️ System Requirements

- **Windows 10/11** (x64 recommended)
- **ProtonVPN Client**
- **Technitium MAC Address Changer**
- **Simple DNSCrypt**
- **Tor Browser (for background SOCKS5 proxy exposure)**
- **Socat64.exe** (Windows version)

Administrative privileges recommended for:
- MAC address re-binding
- System DNS overwrite
- Privileged port binding for proxy forwarding

## ⚡ Quickstart Deployment

| Stage | Action |
|:------|:-------|
| VPN | Connect ProtonVPN with Kill Switch enabled |
| MAC | Randomize MAC address via Technitium |
| DNS | Activate Simple DNSCrypt with forced relays |
| Tor | Run Tor to expose SOCKS5 port 9050 |
| Proxy | Forward app traffic via socat64 into Tor |

> PhantomOPSEC turns Windows into a kinetic ghost —  
> **unseen, unchained, and unreachable.**

---

## 🧠 Final Reminder

Always verify:
- External IP leakage
- DNS resolver integrity
- MAC address fingerprint drift
- SOCKS5 proxy routing functionality

before engaging in live operations.
