# üõ∞Ô∏è Operational Release ‚Äî ShadowDNS v1.0

ShadowDNS is a **next-generation DNS intelligence capture suite**,  
purpose-built for **covert reconnaissance**, **adversarial surveillance**, and **network exfiltration operations**.

It silently **captures**, **fingerprints**, and **analyzes** DNS queries in real time,  
using **stealth-layered packet interception**, **entropy profiling**, and **advanced pattern recognition** ‚Äî  
without alerts, without persistent artifacts, and without external dependencies.

---

## üöÄ Capabilities Breakdown

**Stealth DNS Capture Across Layers**
- Raw socket packet interception (Linux/macOS)
- Scapy-enhanced parsing (optional enrichment)
- WinDivert-based hijacking (Windows kernel traffic interception)
- Real-time Windows DNS cache extraction (fallback stealth)
- ETL event log monitoring (deep Windows DNS surveillance)

**Adaptive Threat Intelligence**
- Suspicious domain detection via:
  - Entropy analysis (high randomness DGA detection)
  - TLD profiling (`.ru`, `.cn`, `.tk`, `.xyz`, `.onion`)
  - Fast-Flux and exfil pattern recognition
  - Anomaly detection on DNS query length and structure

**Full OPSEC Optimization**
- Dynamic privilege detection (admin/root escalation awareness)
- Passive event scraping with memory-first caching
- In-memory SQLite logging (minimal disk I/O)
- Shadow backups with auto-rotation (forensic survivability)

**Real-Time Analysis and Visualization**
- DNS activity statistics (Total queries, Suspicious ratio, Unique domains)
- Timeline traffic plotting (per-hour resolution)
- Top queried domains leaderboard
- Suspicious domain pie chart analysis
- CSV export for external exploitation or reporting

## üß© Operational Workflow

1. **Initialize** ShadowDNS in capture mode (Socket, Scapy, WinDivert, or ETL).
2. **Silently intercept** all DNS queries crossing the host or network interfaces.
3. **Score and fingerprint** every domain using entropy, whitelist, blacklist, and heuristic filters.
4. **Log** captured metadata into an encrypted stealth database (`shadowdns.db`).
5. **Analyze** top domains, suspicious hits, and timeline spikes via built-in stats or exported CSVs.
6. **Exfiltrate**, **profile**, or **weaponize** captured intel as needed.

> ShadowDNS turns the DNS layer into a full-spectrum recon channel ‚Äî  
> **hijacking the network‚Äôs eyes before defenders even notice.**

## üî• Real-World Use Cases

- Pre-reconnaissance for **APT weapon deployment**
- **Red team beacon tracking** via DNS leak mapping
- **Covert C2 infrastructure discovery** (Tor relays, pastebins, DGA clusters)
- **Profiling enterprise network behavior** pre-exploitation
- **Identifying stealth exfiltration vectors** via DNS misuses
- **Building custom target domain lists** for secondary payload deployment

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Optional dependencies (auto-detected if installed):**
  - `scapy`, `dpkt`, `pydivert`, `matplotlib`
- **Admin/root privileges recommended** for full packet interception capabilities.

Supported Operating Systems:
- ‚úÖ Windows 10/11 (ETL + WinDivert + Cache Monitoring)
- ‚úÖ Linux (Socket capture mode)
- ‚úÖ macOS (Socket capture mode)
