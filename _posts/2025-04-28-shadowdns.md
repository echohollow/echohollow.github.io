# üõ∞Ô∏è Operational Release ‚Äî ShadowDNS v1.0

ShadowDNS is a **next-gen DNS intelligence interception suite**,  
engineered for **covert adversarial operations**, **network surveillance**, and **threat reconnaissance missions**.

At its core, ShadowDNS captures, fingerprints, and classifies **all DNS traffic**  
using **multi-layered stealth capture techniques** and **entropy-based anomaly detection** ‚Äî  
**without being detected**, **without requiring external dependencies**, and **without persistent footprints**.

## üöÄ Capabilities Breakdown

üîé **Full Spectrum DNS Capture**  
- Raw socket packet inspection (Linux, macOS)  
- Scapy-enhanced packet parsing (optional)  
- WinDivert-based packet hijacking (Windows)  
- Real-time DNS cache extraction (Windows fallback)  
- ETL event log interception (Windows deep stealth)

‚ö° **Stealth-Optimized Persistence**  
- Dynamic privilege escalation detection  
- Shadow memory caching to minimize forensic artifacts  
- Passive event logging with zero injected drivers  

üß† **Advanced Intelligence Processing**  
- Automatic detection of suspicious domains based on:  
  - **Entropy analysis** (detect DGA - Domain Generation Algorithms)  
  - **TLD profiling** (RU, CN, TK, XYZ, etc.)  
  - **Fast-flux indicators**  
  - **Onion/TOR relay detection**  
  - **Pastebin, Ghostbin exfil channels**  

üìä **Real-Time Statistics & Visualization**  
- Total/Unique domain counters  
- Suspicious domain ratio analysis  
- Live plotting (Timeline, Top Domains, Suspicious Traffic)  
- CSV Export for offline analysis  
- Full interactive OPSEC shell environment

üõ°Ô∏è **Full OPSEC Hardening**  
- Auto-detection of DNS servers from system config  
- Backup and auto-rotation of forensic copies  
- In-memory SQLite database handling  
- Zero-reliance on 3rd-party C2 servers (fully local)

## üß© How ShadowDNS Works

> 1. Start `ShadowDNS` and select your capture mode(s) ‚Äî socket, Scapy, WinDivert, ETL, or fallback.
> 2. Begin passive DNS interception across system, browser, and live network events.
> 3. Real-time domain analysis: Entropy scoring, whitelist filtering, suspicious detection.
> 4. Log everything silently to a stealth database (`shadowdns.db`) while remaining invisible.
> 5. Export, plot, search, or group traffic by parent websites ‚Äî OPSEC-ready for exfil staging or target profiling.

## üî• Real-World Use Cases

- **Pre-reconnaissance for APT deployment**
- **Red team beacon tracking and network fingerprinting**
- **Detecting covert command-and-control domains**
- **Spotting DGA malware in target environments**
- **Stealth exfiltration vector identification**
- **Custom target domain building for next-stage payloads**

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**  
- **Optional:**  
  - `scapy`, `dpkt`, `pydivert`, `matplotlib` (auto-detects if missing)  
- **Admin/root privileges** (for full packet capture capabilities)  

OS Support:  
- Windows 10/11 (Full ETL + WinDivert + Cache Monitoring)  
- Linux (Socket Capture Mode)  
- macOS (Socket Capture Mode)
