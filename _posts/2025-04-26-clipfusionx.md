# 🛡️ Operational Release — ClipFusionX

**ClipFusionX** is a highly specialized clipboard event manipulation framework,  
developed for advanced adversarial simulation, red team exercises, and operational field deployment.

At its core, ClipFusionX is designed to **detect**, **intercept**, and **replace** sensitive clipboard data —  
specifically targeting cryptocurrency wallet addresses — in real time, without user awareness.

---

## 🚀 Two Versions of ClipFusionX

### **Public (Educational) GitHub Release**

A stripped, safe version of ClipFusionX is available publicly at:

🔗 [ClipFusionX GitHub Repository](https://github.com/echohollow/ClipFusionX)

- 📎 Clipboard monitoring simulation only  
- ❌ No real PEB spoofing or clipboard overwrite occurs  
- 🧪 Crypto address detection is logged but not modified  
- 🧠 Built for cybersecurity education, not live operations

This version demonstrates foundational techniques (entropy analysis, clipboard event handling, detection logic)  
but **does not include** any live payloads, runtime persistence, or active stealth modules.

---

### **Private (Operational) Version**

The operational ClipFusionX variant — maintained privately — includes full adversarial capabilities:

- 🔁 Real-time clipboard hijack targeting BTC/ETH formats  
- 🧱 Active **PEB spoofing** to confuse memory scanners and forensic tools  
- 🧬 Memory signature cloaking with high-entropy masking  
- 🧼 Shadow memory overlays to avoid userland AV/EDR detection  
- 🕶️ Behavior-based clipboard triggers  
- 🧯 Self-deletion and in-memory cleanup on successful execution

This version is engineered for **live red team ops, C2 delivery, and threat emulation** —  
with built-in obfuscation, runtime-only logic, and **zero static indicators**.

---

## ⚙️ Core Techniques Used

- Direct access to **TEB/PEB structures** for anti-forensic manipulation  
- Manual memory mapping via `NtCreateSection` + `NtMapViewOfSection`  
- **Shadow buffer encryption** for runtime replacement  
- Entropy + pattern scoring to catch wallets even if obfuscated  
- Lightweight global hook chain (no userland injection)  
- Optional delayed or single-exec mode to evade runtime heuristics

> **ClipFusionX** uses polymorphic runtime strategies and entropy fingerprinting  
> to make static analysis and memory diffing extremely unreliable.

## 📧 Accessing the Operational Build

To maintain OPSEC integrity, the full source and binary are **not public**.

Researchers and verified red team professionals may request access via:

📬 **echohollow@tutamail.com**  
**Subject:** `ClipFusionX Access Request`

**Include the following:**
- 🏢 Affiliation (company, university, or research entity)  
- 🧪 Use case (training, simulation, academic, etc.)  
- 📇 Contact for verification  
- ⚠️ Agreement to responsible use terms

⚠️ **Note:** Only vetted requests will receive access.  
Random emails, burner accounts, or vague inquiries will be ignored.

## 🧠 Final Note

**ClipFusionX** is not a proof of concept — it’s an operational-grade implant core.  
The public version teaches.  
The private version delivers.

**This is clipboard weaponization — memory-only, entropy-aware, and stealth-optimized.**

Use it wisely. Or don’t get access at all.
