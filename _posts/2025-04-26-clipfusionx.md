# 🛡️ Operational Release — ClipFusionX

ClipFusionX is a highly specialized clipboard event manipulation framework,  
developed for advanced adversarial simulation, red team exercises, and operational field deployment.

At its core, ClipFusionX is designed to **detect**, **intercept**, and **replace** sensitive clipboard data —  
specifically targeting cryptocurrency wallet addresses — in real time, without user awareness.

---

## 🚀 Two Versions of ClipFusionX

**Public (Educational) GitHub Release:**

A stripped, safe version of ClipFusionX is available publicly at:

🔗 [ClipFusionX GitHub Repository](https://github.com/echohollow/ClipFusionX)

- **Clipboard monitoring simulation only**  
- **No real PEB spoofing or clipboard overwrite occurs**  
- **Crypto address detection is logged but not modified**  
- **Built for cybersecurity education, not live operations**

This version demonstrates core techniques (entropy analysis, clipboard event monitoring, and detection)  
but **excludes** any live payload replacement, active persistence, or forensic evasion modules.

---

**Private (Operational) Release:**

The real operational ClipFusionX version — maintained privately —  
features fully weaponized capabilities, including:

- **Real-time clipboard hijack and replacement targeting BTC/ETH wallets**
- **Active PEB (Process Environment Block) spoofing to evade analysis**
- **Memory region signature cloaking with entropy pattern masking**
- **Shadow memory overlays to bypass userland AV/EDR detection**
- **Dynamic clipboard monitoring with behavioral triggers**
- **Stealth self-cleanup and trace minimization routines**

This version is engineered for **true adversarial field deployment**  
and is resistant to most signature-based detection techniques.

---

## ⚙️ Core Techniques Used

- Direct Windows **TEB/PEB access** with fallbacks to safe system calls
- Dynamic memory mapping via **NtCreateSection** and **NtMapViewOfSection**
- **Shadow region allocation** for string obfuscation
- High-entropy pattern matching to detect cryptocurrency address structures
- Lightweight operational hooks to minimize artifact creation

> ClipFusionX employs memory signature polymorphism and entropy manipulation,  
> making detection and forensic tracing highly unreliable without active memory scanning.

## 🎯 Important Notice to Researchers

To maintain operational security,  
the **full private weaponized source code and binary are not publicly released.**

Researchers, security analysts, and legitimate red teams who wish to request access to the **full operational ClipFusionX** must:

- Email: **[YOUR EMAIL HERE]**
- Subject: `ClipFusionX Access Request`
- Provide a clear statement of purpose, including:
  - Affiliation (company, university, research lab)
  - Intended use (red team, malware research, educational, etc.)
  - Contact details for verification

**Only properly vetted requests will receive access.  
Random download requests will not be entertained.**

---

# 📡 Closing Notes

ClipFusionX represents the next evolution of clipboard intelligence weaponization:  
**memory-resident, stealth-optimized, and adversarially hardened.**

Public versions demonstrate the underlying concepts safely.  
Private versions enable true operational capability against real-world targets.

Stay tuned for upcoming modules expanding persistence, mobility, and deeper Windows API abuse.
