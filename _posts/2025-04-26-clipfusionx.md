# 🛡️ First Release — ClipFusionX Prototype

Today, we're excited to announce the **first prototype** of **ClipFusionX** —  
a simulation framework built to explore and train against clipboard intelligence behavior.

---

## 🚀 What is ClipFusionX?

ClipFusionX is designed for:

- **Clipboard event interception**
- **Behavioral monitoring simulation**
- **Adversarial clipboard manipulation training**

It is tailored specifically for:

- Red teams
- Threat emulation programs
- Operational research labs

---

## ⚙️ Key Features (Prototype v0.1)

- Real-time clipboard content analysis
- Dynamic event simulation modules
- Configurable interception rulesets
- Lightweight footprint for stealth simulation

---

## 🎯 Purpose Behind ClipFusionX

In modern cyber operations, clipboard attacks are a rising vector —  
targeting sensitive copy-paste actions like passwords, crypto wallet addresses, and confidential data snippets.

ClipFusionX allows researchers and operators to **simulate**, **detect**, and **respond** to these adversarial clipboard behaviors **before** facing them in the wild.

---

## 🛠️ What's Next?

We are currently working on:

- Expanded simulation modules (mimicking real-world malware behaviors)
- Advanced clipboard manipulation techniques
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux, Mac)
